        Let's start with your affinity for us. It seems like you've visited us {{current_month_logins}} times this past month, as opposed to
        {{previous_month_logins}} times last month.{% if current_month_logins > previous_month_logins %} That is great news!! We appreciate your liking towards us!!
        {% else %} That is heartbreaking for us, but we hope to see you more next month!!{% endif %}
            </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            Now let's take a look at your popularity in the last month. The following graphs will summarize what the other users think of you:
